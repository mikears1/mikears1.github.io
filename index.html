    <h1>Hello JAM stack!</h1>
    <p>This is my first Website ever.</p>

    <p>My name is Michael, I am a MIS student at Texas A&M University. I am set to graduate in December 2026.<br>
       I made this website for an assignment in ISTM 310, Network Communications and Infrastructure.<br>
       I am interested in pursuing a career in data analytics. My previous internship with the City of Fort Worth introduced me to the use of platforms such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI, and ArcGIS to transform and draw insights from data.<br>
       I have sought to further develop these skills through completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate and working on developing portfolio projects.
    </p>

    <p> One data analysis project I have worked is a comprehensive supply chain analysis for HEB, leveraging Python, Excel, and Power BI to optimize distribution efficiency and measure environmental impact.<br>
        Using a custom Python pipeline with pandas, NumPy, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, and Contextily, I calculated route-level carbon emissions based on Haversine distance, truck type, and payload.<br>
        I then visualized emissions across distribution centers and retail markets with interactive maps, and aggregated the data to generate actionable insights.<br>
        Finally, I created KPIs and dashboards in Power BI to compare emissions and transportation distances across different distribution scenarios, enabling data-driven decisions for sustainability and operational improvements.
