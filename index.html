    <h1>Hello JAM stack!</h1>

    <p>I conducted a comprehensive supply chain analysis for HEB, leveraging Python, Excel, and Power BI to optimize distribution efficiency and measure environmental impact.<br>
       Using a custom Python pipeline with pandas, NumPy, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, and Contextily, I calculated route-level carbon emissions based on Haversine distance, truck type, and payload.<br>
       I visualized emissions across distribution centers and retail markets with interactive maps and aggregated the data to generate actionable insights.<br>
       I also created KPIs and dashboards in Power BI to compare emissions and transportation distances across different distribution scenarios, enabling data-driven decisions for sustainability and operational improvements.</p>

    <p> One data analysis project I have worked is a comprehensive supply chain analysis for HEB, leveraging Python, Excel, and Power BI to optimize distribution efficiency and measure environmental impact.<br>
        Using a custom Python pipeline with pandas, NumPy, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, and Contextily, I calculated route-level carbon emissions based on Haversine distance, truck type, and payload.<br>
        I then visualized emissions across distribution centers and retail markets with interactive maps, and aggregated the data to generate actionable insights.<br>
        Finally, I created KPIs and dashboards in Power BI to compare emissions and transportation distances across different distribution scenarios, enabling data-driven decisions for sustainability and operational improvements.
